I. Requirements:
	+ Part 1
		This part requires us to implement the system calls Acquire and Release for the Lock class as well as Wait, Signal, and Broadcast for the Condition class. In addition we have to implement the constructor and destructor system calls CreateLock, DestroyLock, CreateCondition and DestroyCondition. The system calls have to be protected from user program errors so user programs cannot crash the OS. For example, CreateLock and CreateCondition has to return an interger value so the user does not handle the kernel space pointer directly. Finally, we have to create a test suite to prove that these system calls work and do not crash Nachos when used correctly and incorrectly. 

	+ Part 2
		This part requires us to implement the Exec and Fork system calls to allow for multiprogramming in Nachos. We are also required to create a test suite to prove that these system calls work and do not crash Nachos when used correctly and incorrectly.

	+ Part 3
		This part requires us to recreate the Passport Office from project 1, part 2 as a set of multithreaded Nachos user programs, using the system calls created during this project. We are also required to create a test suite to prove that the implementation works correctly. 

-Describe what's your understanding of the requirements from the assignment statement. With the requirement analysis, you would be clear about what you are supposed to do.

II. Assumptions:
	For our assumptions, we assumed that:


III. Design:
	+ Part 1

	+ Part 2

	+ Part 3	

- This section is to cover your logic and ideas as to how  you are going to solve the problem presented.  This should include a description of classes, algorithms, etc. This is not code. You must document ALL parts of a project.

            Only created one new structure - the processEntry structure for the process table
            //In structs.h
            ProcessEntry{
                int pID
                int numThreads

            }
            class AddrSpace{
                //Added in a stack bit map to help with stack allocation
                //Added numNonStackPages to help with stack address computation
                //Added a stack bit map lock to protect clears and finds
                //Added in a process ID int to keep track of a process index

                //Added in a new method with, in a threadsafe way, finds a new 
                //stack space for a forked thread. Uses the bit map lock
            }

		+ Functions added and in which file.
            //In addrspace.cc:
                Added a method for finding new stack spaces for forked threads
            //In exception.cc:
                - Added in a kernel_fork method which
                    - is forked after the fork syscall. u
                    - used to set registers, page table, and call Machine->run()

                - Added in a kernel_exec method which
                    - is thread forked to after an exec_syscall.
                    - sets registers, page table and calls Machine->run()
                
		+ Functions modified and in which file.
            //In addrspace.cc:
                Modified the addresspace constructor
                    - to have a process ID
                    - To have a set of stack pages allocated on fork
                    - to use a global physical memory bitmap for loading
            //In progtest.cc:
                Modified start process to do the same things as in the address
                space constructor
            //In exception.cc:
                Modified Exec_syscall
                    - To open the executable file
                    - To add a new entry to the process table, which has 1 
                    thread, is set to running, and has an incremented pID
                    - Creates a new address space, which keeps track of its
                    pID, reads the executable into bitmap find spots in physical
                    memory, and instantiates a stack bitmap
                Modified Fork_syscall
                    - To create a new thread,
                    - set the threads addresspsace to the current address 
                    space
                    - sets its stack, and increments the process table's entry 
                    for that process to have one more running thread
                Modified Exit_syscall
                    - To halt the machine is there is only one last thread
                    - To delete the address space and kernel data, and free the
                    phyiscal memory pages when a process's last thread exits
                    - To free a thread's stack pages when it is not the last
                    thread in an exit

V. Testing:  (For each test case, you must show)
	+ Part 1
		+ How to test
			To run tests for part 1, compile in the /test/ directory, then go to the /userprog/ directory and type the command "nachos -x ../test/testpart1"

		+ Test Output
			The structure of the output for each section of the test begins with a title, specifying which system calls are being tested. Each test case output begins with "Test: " followed by a short description of what is being tested. There may be some intermediate print statements from the kernel and the last line for one case should end with "Result: " followed by "Success". If any of the test cases failed, the result will say "Fail".
	
	+ Part 2
		+ How to test
			To run tests for part 2, compile in the /test/ directory, then go to the /userprog/ directory and type the command "nachos -x ../test/testpart2"
	
		+ Test Output
	
	
	+ Part 3
		+ How to test
			To run tests for part 3, compile in the /test/ directory, then go to the /userprog/ directory and type the command "nachos -x ../test/testpart3"

	- How to run the test cases, the commands, the arguments and so on.
		+ Test Output
	- Describe the testing output. You don't have to dump all the output info. Just make sure your description can exactly reflect your output. The grader of your submission will be wanting to compare the output they get with what you say the output is.

VI. Discussion:
	+ Experiment expectation.  (What is supposed to happen.)
	+ Experiment result.  (What actually happened.)
	+ Explanation
		- Explain your experiment result - how it proves what 
		  you were supposed to prove.

VIII. Miscellaneous:
- Whatever else you want the grader know about your development.  You can create your own subsections headings here.
